//           People with Down syndrome want to meet up with their buddies just as
//           everyone else. However, they have a different perception, often
//           combined with a poor eye sight. This makes it hard to operate
//           software. Some social platforms additionally also carry the risk of
//           hate speech and discrimination. <br></br> <br></br>
//           Downtown is a platform that provides an accessible, digital meet-up
//           spot for people with Down syndrome. Accessibility and an operability
//           as simple and easy as possible without loss of security is most
//           important. The platforms provides several easy-to-use video chat rooms
//           as well as a group chat. Our group is currently implementing more
//           features. For this, we are using the MERN-stack and WebRTC for the
//           video chatrooms.

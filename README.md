# Hey there, welcome to my portfolio website

This is the code I have written, you are welcome to take a look at it. 

## Used tech for this website

- website created in React JS
- translations: i18next
- custom CSS styles
- Lottie animation (see 404 Errorpage)


## Accessibility

Following the WCAG criteria, accessibility is achieved by implementing...

- sufficient color contrast (AAA level)
- line-spacing of 1.6
- semantic HTML used effectively
- tab indexes
- implemented prefers-reduced-motion: animations of flipping cards are minimized
- animations such as flipping cards or tooltips require user-interactivity (clicking, hovering) instead of just appearing unexpectedly, hence making the UX less confusing
- aria-labels where necessary
- alt-Attributes and titles set
- form fields contain a label
- skip to main content link
... and more

The page is operable by keyboard and can be read entirely by screen readers. However, the accessibility for this page has not been tested yet by people who actually have permanent challenges. So if you notice an aspect that can be further improved, let me know :-)
